# Cortana Skills Kit #

The **Cortana Skills Kit** is a suite of tools that helps you build custom, intelligent, personalized experiences for your users by empowering Cortana with new capabilities (or **skills**).

>Note: Cortana Skills Kit is currently in public preview.

Cortana skills can be built using the **Microsoft Bot Service**. The framework enables you to build conversational experiences that support different types of interactions with users. You can design freeform or guided interactions using simple text strings, speech or use complex rich cards that contain text, images, audio and action buttons.

Cortana Skills Kit also enables you to **personalize skill experiences** for your users by requesting for and leveraging contextual data like the user profile and location information.

*   Review the [Cortana Skills Kit documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana/getstarted) to get started!
*   Refer to the [Bot Framework documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/) to create great conversational experiences
*   .NET and Node.js developers can take advantage of the [Bot Builder SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-overview) to start creating Skills
*   Use the [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) to start free and keep going free - regardless of your subscription type

You can add **natural language understanding** to your skill by using the [Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)](https://www.luis.ai/), which uses the power of machine learning to help extract meaning from natural language input. A LUIS app takes a user utterance and extracts intents and entities that correspond to activities in your skill.

You can add **responsive UI** to your skill on devices with screens using [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/).

Also check out **Question and Answer Maker** that converts FAQs into bots in minutes via [QNAMaker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/).
